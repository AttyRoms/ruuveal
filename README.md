ruuveal ALPHA
=============

ruuveal decrypts encrypted RUUs (zip) files released by HTC.

It is currently an ALPHA version, meaning it probably has bugs or will cause the end of the world as we know it. You have been warned. 

You will need to extract the zip file from the RUU executable before you can use this tool - use Google, there are a few methods.

Usage
-----

    $ ruuveal device encrypted-rom.zip output.zip

For example:

    $ ruuveal jewel rom_01.zip rom_01_decrypted.zip

Once you have decrypted the zip file, it should unzip with any standard zip utility.
